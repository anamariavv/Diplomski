# Diplomski

## TODO

- prey and predators are entities
- Only predators have hunger, preys must only survive
- each predator should have its own timer for hunger, instead of a global timer event
- cleanup the code and modularize it
- create a fitness function that works for both predators and preys
- repository is diplomski
- speed up the simulation by using number of steps instead of time and speed
- investigate how the network is performing, what it is doing and how it should be optimised


### 20.9
- preys must know if they are eaten  
- how will the network evolve? how do i know when prey die?-> try if all predators are dead, reset the simulation
