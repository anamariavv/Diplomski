# Diplomski

## TODO

-prey and predators are entities
-Only predators have hunger, preys must only survive
-each predator should have its own timer for hunger, instead of a global timer event
-cleanup the code and modularize it
-create a fitness function that works for both predators and preys
-repository is diplomski
-speed up the simulation by using number of steps instead of time and speed
-investigate how the network is performing, what it is doing and how it should be optimised
